Hello, my name is Totthong Lertvanarin, TONY. In this introductory GitHub, I have compiled various files and information based on lessons learned from my MADT class. 

Due to my non-technical nature, I hereby hope this compendium of knowledge can assist anyone who is interested in customer analytics and is looking to get a foot in the door as my explanations will stem from a non-technical point of view. 
I thus leave the coding to a more capable hand, while focusing on the 'why' the code is needed, rather than how it is executed.
