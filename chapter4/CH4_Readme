Customer segmentation is a strategic marketing practice that involves dividing a company's customer base into distinct groups or segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors.

Customer segmentation is essential for businesses to effectively target their marketing efforts and tailor products or services to specific customer groups.

It begins with the collection and analysis of customer data, including demographics, purchase history, preferences, and behaviors.

Segmentation criteria can include factors such as age, gender, location, income, buying habits, interests, and more.

Businesses use segmentation to create detailed customer profiles or personas, representing each segment's characteristics.

By categorizing customers into segments, businesses can better understand their diverse needs and preferences.

Customer segmentation enables personalized marketing strategies that resonate with each group, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.

It helps in optimizing resource allocation by focusing marketing resources on the most promising customer segments.

Segmentation can be dynamic, with segments evolving over time as customer behaviors and preferences change.

Businesses often use segmentation in conjunction with other marketing strategies, such as targeting, positioning, and product development.

Effective customer segmentation enhances customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, a company's bottom line by tailoring offerings and communication to specific customer segments.
